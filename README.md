## Overview & Origin

- Name: Square, Inc.

- Incorporation Date: June 2009 (Deleware)

-  The company was founded by Cameron Walters, Tristan O'Tierney, Randy Reddig, Jack Dorsey, and Jim McKelvey

- Jim Mckelvy (founder) was an artist several years ago. One year Jim visted an art fair with hopes to trade his passion for pay by selling some of his art. However, Jim missed a $2000 sale becuase the only form of pay he accepted was cash. This created a brain storm session beteen Jim and Jack Dorsey (founder) in which Square, Inc was birthed from.

- Square is currently a publicly traded comapany with aproxamately 390 millions shares outstanding with a current price per share of $216.44 per share.

## Business Activities

- Square started of solving a huge problem for small buisess owners and merchants. Lots of small buinesses did not have a convenient way to collect credit card transactions. The best part about Square's credit card termianl is, its portible and it connects to the owners cell phone making it possible for business owners to collect payment fast and easy. Square has added other services to their line up. These new services consist of sending cash to others, tax filing, even bitcoin trading.... which can all be done from a cell phone.

- Square's intended customer is a person with a cell phone that likes money, and if you are a business owner with a cell phone that likes money, even better! One "unfair advantage" that Square has is it's CEO Jack Dorsey. Dorsey is also the CEO of another lage company, twitter. This gives Square a direct connection to the people via Twitter. As long as you are connected to people, your can develop their, likes, dislikes, needs etc. The nest part about it is, its absoulely free for Square. So powerfull!

- Square currently uses application software that can be downloaded to any smart phone or tablet.

## Landscape

- Square has its toe in many different Finteck domains. Square is in payments/billing, capital investment, weath management, personal finance/deposits/online banking, lending, and crytocurrencies. Square's subsidary, CashApp is a plays a huge role is most of these services.

- The largest innovation for Square was the purchase of  CashApp. Square also added more sevices to CashApp to simplfy life for its users. CashApp allows direct deposit from employers, cryto trading, and now tax filing.

- One other major company in this domain is Paypal, Square's largest competitor.

## Results

- A core metric to measure Square's success would be the Covid-19 pandemic. in 2019, Covid arrived and hope, happiness, money and life disappeared for many people. Millions of people lost their jobs during this time, which forced people to get creative with side hustles. 4.4 new busineses were started in 2020, and since small businesses need a way to process credit card transactions, this may have spiked membership for Square. Also in 2020 Square's stock price soar from a low of $40 to a high of $221 due to the high demand for it's services.

- Square is deffenately appling pressure to it's largest competitor, Paypal. Though Paypal has a longer track record and a strong fan base, Square's actions show that they are aimimg for the #1 spot. Though Square and Paypal offer similar services, Square just purchased Tidal, a music streaming platform. Though music is not related to fintech,Paypal has yet to do this, I thought it would be cool to mention this fun fact!

## Recommendations

- One service that I think Square should offer is financial literacy options for it's members. 

- This could benefit Square because the company and it's members are so connected to money but last years pandemic showed the world just how important proper money management is. What is the use of making money (business owners) sending money, trading money for stock if the basic skill of money management is overlooked and forgotten?

- This service will only require internet and a FaceTime-like feature that allows members to chat with financial professionals about partictular financials with the click of a button.
